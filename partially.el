;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; I like small, focused libraries. This one provides some functionality
;; around rails partials. Supports erb and haml

;; partially/visit-partial     - jump to the partial rendered on the current line
;; NOT DONE!! partially/extract-partial   - extract a partial, dump it in a file, and render it in the current file
;; NOT DONE!! partially/inline-partial    - fetch the partial rendered on the current line, and replace the render statement with it

;;; Installation:

;; This relies on a "find-root" function. It defaults to railway-find-root (my standalone rails minor mode),
;; but can easily be customized to anything

;; (setq partially:rails-root-fn 'rinari-root) ; use rinari function
;; (setq partially:rails-root-fn 'eproject-root) ; use eproject function
;; (setq partially:rails-root-fn 'projectile-get-project-root) ; use projectile function
;; (setq partially:rails-root-fn 'textmate-project-root) ; use textmate.el function
